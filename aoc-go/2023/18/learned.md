To find the area of a polygon we can use the [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula).
Since the vertex are integer coordinates, we can combine it with [Pick's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pick%27s_theorem)

A = i + b/2 - 1
So A + 1 = i + b/2
So A + b / 2 + 1 = i + b 

with b the number of elements on the border and i the number of elements in the interior.
