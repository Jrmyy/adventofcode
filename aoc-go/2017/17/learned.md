For part 2, there is no need to create a list of 50 millions records. 
Since the zero is always at the front of the list, we just have to simulate as we were adding a 
list and if the index is 1 (meaning right after zero), we keep track of the value.
Looping over 50 millions is not too costly, inserting in a list of capacity 50 millions is.
